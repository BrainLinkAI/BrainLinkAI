## BrainLinkAI
At BrainLinkAI we understand that AI brings limitless value to our daily lives and can better the future for all of us. However, current systems in place are NOT effective. We are working separately for money and greed when we could work together. But how can we do that?

## The Link
An AI agent may be capable of reading and translating code, and a separate unrelated agent might write in the language of code that you are working with. BrainLinkAI helps LINK these two agents by reading the code of each agent and helping them work on 1 task together.

## What's To Come?
Our agent terminal website will also soon where we will have a more user friendly platform for those who aren't wizards with code.
